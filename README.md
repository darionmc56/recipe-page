# 🍽️ Recipe Page Project

This project is a **static recipe page** built using **semantic HTML and CSS**. It was created as a layout-focused challenge to reinforce semantic structure, styling tables, and practicing responsive design concepts.

---

## 📌 Overview

The goal of this project was to build a clean, semantic, and responsive recipe page layout. The page contains multiple sections like the recipe title, image, ingredients, instructions, and a styled table for nutritional information.

---

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Semantic HTML5**
- **CSS3** – for styling, layout, and responsive adjustments
- **Mobile-first approach** *(applied retroactively)*

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

I was most proud of building such a large layout from scratch. It taught me how important structure and planning are when working on multi-section pages. Next time, I would:
- Begin with a **centered main section** and build outward.
- Use a **mobile-first approach** from the start to improve responsiveness.

## 🧱 Challenges Faced

One of the biggest challenges was **creating and styling the nutrition table**. I didn’t fully understand how to use table elements before, so I had to pause and study proper table semantics and CSS styling techniques — which turned out to be a surprisingly enjoyable learning experience!

## 💡 Areas for Improvement

I realized I need more practice with:
- **Larger layout structures**, especially managing vertical spacing and stacking elements consistently.
- **Aligning headings and sections** so that repeated patterns (like multiple `<h2>` elements) maintain a consistent and visually pleasing alignment.

## 🙋 Feedback Request

I'd love specific feedback on:
- My **table structure and styling** — does it follow best practices?
- **Responsiveness** — does the layout hold up well on mobile?
- **Semantic HTML** — are there any areas where I could have used more appropriate tags?

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

This challenge was inspired by my ongoing journey to master HTML/CSS fundamentals and build clean, accessible, and well-structured user interfaces.
